Hi!


Here are the deets: 

"

ssh -X scat@spire#.caltech.edu    

where # can be numbers 1 to 9. I think 8 and 9 are the bigger machines. 
when prompted, password is scat3817SP


copying data back to your computer to view it would be, typing from your machine, 

scp scat@spire#.caltech.edu:/path/to/file /path/to/target/folder/

"

All the best, 
Charlotte
