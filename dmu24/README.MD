# DMU 24 Photometric Redshift Repository
===========================

This repository contains all the HELP photometric redshifts (photo-zs) across the various HELP fields. These catalogues include photo-z estimates for subsets of the corresponding field masterlists (DMU1).

Each field will contain:

Notebook 1_Photo-z_QC_and_Diagnostics.ipynb which presents an overview of the photometric redshifts for the field, including information of the input catalogue used, steps applied in the photo-z estimation and the filters used. A series of diagnostic plots are also included to enable assessment of the photo-z quality.
Notebook 2_Photo-z_Selection_Function.ipynb which describes the creation of selection function maps to describe the likelihood of a source having a photo-z in a given HEALpix cell as a function of a specified magnitude.
