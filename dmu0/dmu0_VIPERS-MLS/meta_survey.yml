Acknowledgement: This research makes use of the VIPERS-MLS database, operated at
  CeSAM/LAM, Marseille, France. This work is based in part on observations
  obtained with WIRCam, a joint project of CFHT, Taiwan, Korea, Canada and
  France. The CFHT is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada,
  the Institut National des Science de l’Univers of the Centre National de la
  Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii. This
  work is based in part on observations made with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer
  (GALEX). GALEX is a NASA Small Explorer, whose mission was developed in
  cooperation with the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) of France and
  the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology. GALEX is operated for NASA by
  the California Institute of Technology under NASA contract NAS5-98034. This
  work is based in part on data products produced at TERAPIX available at the
  Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
  Legacy Survey, a collaborative project of NRC and CNRS. The TERAPIX team has
  performed the reduction of all the WIRCAM images and the preparation of the
  catalogues matched with the T0007 CFHTLS data release.
