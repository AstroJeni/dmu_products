VIPERS Multi-Lambda Survey on W1 field
======================================

This resource contains the W1 catalogue of the VIPERS Multi-Lambda Survey
(VIPERS-MLS, PI: S. Arnouts) limited to HELP coverage.

Full catalogues and documentation are available at
http://cesam.lam.fr/vipers-mls/. In particular, users should first read the
photometric procedure described in Moutard et al. 2016a and Moutard et al. 2016b
before using the catalogues.

All the sources of the catalogue falls in the XMM-LSS field.

Note that even if this catalogue is based on the CFHTLS T0007 release, it is
a little different from the CFHTLS catalogues as Moutard et al. worked on the
individual tile catalogues and merged them in a slightly different way compared
to the CFHTLS release.
