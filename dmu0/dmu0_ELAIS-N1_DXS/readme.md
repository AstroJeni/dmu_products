UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey / Deep Extragalactic Survey (UKIDSS/DXS)
=======================================================================

The catalogue was provided by Eduardo from an extraction made by Mattia. The
catalogue is quite different from what can be extracted from the UKIDSS database
(FIXME: Mattia to explain why). The descriptions of the columns of the DXS table
in the UKIDSS database is available there:
