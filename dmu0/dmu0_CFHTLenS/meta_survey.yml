Acknowledgement: We use data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey
  (Heymans et al. 2012), hereafter referred to as CFHTLenS. The CFHTLenS survey
  analysis combined weak lensing data processing with THELI (Erben et al. 2013),
  shear measurement with lensfit (Miller et al. 2013), and photometric redshift
  measurement with PSF-matched photometry(Hildebrandt et al. 2012). A full
  systematic error analysis of the shear measurements in combination with the
  photometric redshifts is presented in Heymans et al. (2012), with additional
  error analyses of the photometric redshift measurements presented in
  Benjamin et al. (2013).
  This work is based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint
  project of CFHT and CEA/IRFU, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
  which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the
  Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la
  Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii. This
  research used the facilities of the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre operated
  by the National Research Council of Canada with the support of the Canadian
  Space Agency. CFHTLenS data processing was made possible thanks to significant
  computing support from the NSERC Research Tools and Instruments grant program.
