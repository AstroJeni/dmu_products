VISTA-CFHT Stripe 82 Survey (VICS82)
====================================

This product contains the Ks selected catalogue from the VISTA-CFHT Stripe 82
Survey (VICS82).  It was downloaded from http://stri-cluster.herts.ac.uk/vics82/
and limited to HELP coverage.

The catalogue is missing documentation. I suppose that `MAG_AUTO` and `MAG_APER`
columns are for Ks band and `MAGJ_AUTO` and `MAGJ_APER` are for the J band.

The aperture magnitude columns contains 5 values, we don't know the
corresponding apertures, if the values are in Vega or AB system, nor if the
magnitudes are aperture corrected.

We asked Jim Geach for more information.
