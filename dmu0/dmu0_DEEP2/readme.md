DEEP2 Photometric Catalogue
===========================

This product contains the DEEP2 DR4 photometric catalogues. Downloaded from
http://deep.ps.uci.edu/DR4/photo.html

The DEEP2 survey provide catalogues on several subfields. We merged all the
catalogues adding a subfield column containing the subfield number of the
sources (e.g., the sources from pcat.11.fits.gz will have the value 11 in the
subfield column). Then we limited the table to the sources within HELP coverage
and added a field column containing the name of the HELP field.

Within HELP, the DEEP2 sources are on EGS and Herschel-Stripe-82 fields.
