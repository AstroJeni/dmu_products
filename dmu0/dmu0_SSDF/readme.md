Spitzer-South Pole Telescope Deep Field (SSDF)
==============================================

The product contains the IRAC catalogues from the Spitzer-South Pole Telescope
Deep Field (SSDF) downloaded from IRSA.

 The Spitzer-South Pole Telescope Deep Field (SSDF) is a wide-area survey using
 IRAC to cover 94 square degrees of extragalactic sky, making it the largest
 IRAC survey completed to date outside the Milky Way midplane. The SSDF is
 centred at 23:30,-55:00, in a region that combines observations spanning
 a broad wavelength range from numerous facilities. These include millimetre
 imaging from the South Pole Telescope, far-infrared observations from
 Herschel/SPIRE, X-ray observations from the XMM XXL survey, near-infrared
 observations from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, and radio-wavelength imaging
 from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, in a panchromatic project designed
 to address major outstanding questions surrounding galaxy clusters and the
 baryon budget.

There are two catalogues: ssdf.i1 is the list of 3.6µm (IRAC channel 1) selected
sources and ssdf.i2 is the list of 4.5µm (channel 2) selected sources.

The catalogues were not limited to HELP (SPIRE based) SSDF field coverage as the
IRAC as only a few parts of the IRAC coverage is not on the SPIRE one.

To identify uniquely a row (e.g. when cross-matching), please use the cntr
column.
