VISTA-VIDEO catalogues (private)
================================

This product contains the private version of the VISTA-VIDEO catalogues. We used
the `VIDEO-all_2016-04-14_fullcat_errfix.fits` downloaded from
http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~video/data/VIDEO_all/cats/


In an electronic mail, Boris Haeussler described the `errfix` catalogue as:

    The errfix version of each catalogue fixes the error bars given by
    SExtractor by creating fake positions in all images and taking the
    uncertainties from there. I THINK this is described in Matts initial VIDEO
    paper.  The values themselves in the catalogues are identical, it's jus the
    error bars that should be more realistic.


The description of the columns (from the DR4 version) is available
[there](http://horus.roe.ac.uk/vsa/www/VIDEODR4/VIDEODR4_TABLE_videoSourceSchema.html)

There is also a readme in the `data` folder.

The video fields are fully included in HELP ones.

The `ID` column is unique for each source in each field (but not cross-field).
