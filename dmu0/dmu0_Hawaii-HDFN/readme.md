Hawaii Hubble Deep Field North Catalogues
=========================================

This product contains the catalogues from the Hawaii Hubble Deep Field North.
These are two multi-band catalogues extracted at R and Z band detections, and
contains fluxes in these bands:

- U from the MOSAIC instrument on the KPNO telescope;
- B, V, R, I, and z’ from the Suprime-Cam instrument on the Subaru telescope;
- HK’ from the QUIRC instrument on the University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope.

We downloaded the 8 tables from the [web page of the
project](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~capak/hdf/index.html) and joined them in
two catalogues using the provided identifiers.

The data folder contains the orginial tables as well as the joined `R.fits` and
`Z.fits` catalogues (the name correspond to the detection band).  It allso
contains the reference article and a longuer version of it that can be found on
the project web site.

All the sources of theses catalogues fall in the HELP HDF-N field.
