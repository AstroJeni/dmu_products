UV-to-FIR Analysis of Spitzer/IRAC Sources in the Extended Groth Strip
======================================================================

This product contains the UV-to-FIR catalogue from Barro et al. (2011) on the
Extended Groth Strip. The catalogue was downloaded in ASCII formation from
http://rainbowx.fis.ucm.es/Rainbow_navigator_public/cache/groth/IRAC_DR1plus/source_table_140417_19.27.txt
and converted to FITS.

We kept the ASCII headers in the `headers.txt` file.

The catalogue is described in
[2011ApJS..193...13B](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2011ApJS..193...13B/abstract).
