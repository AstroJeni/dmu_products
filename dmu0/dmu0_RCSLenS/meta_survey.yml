Acknowledgement: We use data from the Red Cluster Sequence Lensing Survey
  (Hildebrandt et al. 2016), hereafter referred to as RCSLenS which is based on
  the Red Sequence Cluster Survey 2 (Gilbank et al. 2011). The RCSLenS team
  combined weak lensing data processing with THELI (Erben et al. 2012), shear
  measurement with lensfit (Miller et al. 2012), and photometric redshift
  measurement with PSF-matched photometry (Hildebrandt et al. 2012). A full
  systematic error analysis of the shear measurements in combination with the
  photometric redshifts is presented in Hildebrandt et al. (2016), with
  additional error analyses of the photometric redshift measurements presented
  in Choi et al.  (2016).

  This work is based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint
  project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
  which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the
  Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la
  Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii. This
  research used the facilities of the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre operated by
  the National Research Council of Canada with the support of the Canadian Space
  Agency.  RCSLenS data processing was made possible thanks to significant
  computing support from the NSERC Research Tools and Instruments grant program.
