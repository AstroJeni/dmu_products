CANDELS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) Multiwavelength catalog (Galametz et al. 2013)
==============================================================================

This product contains the CANDELS multi-wavelength catalogue on the deep UDS
field within HELP. Here is its description on the survey web site:

> The catalog presents the multiwavelength (ultraviolet to mid-infrared)
> photometry available in the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) field observed as
> part of CANDELS. It includes the CANDELS HST data (near-infrared WFC3 F125W
> and F160W and visible ACS F606W and F814W), u-band data from CFHT/Megacam, B,
> V , Rc, i′ and z′ band data from Subaru/Suprime-Cam, Y and Ks band data from
> VLT/HAWK-I, J, H and K bands data from UKIDSS (Data Release 8), and
> Spitzer/IRAC data (3.6, 4.5 from SEDS, 5.8 and 8.0μm from SpUDS). The source
> detection is based on the 2-epoch F160W mosaic. The catalog contains 35932
> sources over an area of 201.7 square arcmin. It was also cross-matched with
> existing lists of radio and X-ray detected sources as well as spectroscopic
> redshifts available in the UDS.

The catalogue is described in 2013ApJS..206...10G.
