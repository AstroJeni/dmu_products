Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area (SHELA) survey
====================================================

This product contains the catalogue from the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory
Large-Area (SHELA) survey.

    The Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area (SHELA) survey covers ~24 sq. deg
    at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The survey area falls within the footprints of the
    Sloan Digital Sky Survey "Stripe 82" region, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark
    Energy Experiment (HETDEX), and the Dark Energy Survey. The images and
    catalogs are 80% (50%) complete to limiting magnitudes of 22.0 (22.6) AB mag
    in the detection image, which is constructed from the weighted sum of the
    IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron images. The catalogs reach limiting sensitivities of
    1.1 microJy at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns (1Ïƒ, for R = 2" circular apertures).

The data was downloaded from http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/SHELA/
and is the combined epoch catalogue.  It is described in
[2016ApJS..224...28P](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016ApJS..224...28P/abstract).
