====================================================

These catalogues where provided by Eduardo and are described in
[2011MNRAS.416..927G](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2011MNRAS.416..927G).

There are four catalogues:

- 'en1_intwfc_v2.1.fits'
- 'en2_intwfc_v2.1.fits'
- 'fls_intwfc_v2.1.fits'
- 'lh_intwfc_v2.1.fits'

We may limit the catalogues to HELP coverage, for instance
`en1_intwfc_v2.1_HELP_coverage.fits` is the catalogue on ELAIS-N1 HELP coverage.

The magnitudes are AB ones and are aperture corrected. The aperture closest to
2 arc-seconds is aperture 4 (1.7 arc-seconds).
