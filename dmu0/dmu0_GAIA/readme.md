GAIA DR1 catalogue
==================

This product contains the first data release (DR1) of Gaia (Global Astrometric
Interferometer for Astrophysics). The gaia_source catalogue was downloaded from
the Gaia Archive and limited to HELP coverage. We also added a field column
containing the name of the HELP field associated to each source for easy
filtering.

The complete description of the catalogue columns is available there:
