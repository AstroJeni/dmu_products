CANDELS GOODS-S Multiwavelenght catalog (Guo et al. 2013)
=========================================================

This product contains the CANDELS multi-wavelength catalogue on the deep
GOODS-South field within HELP CDFS-SWIRE field. Here is its description on the
survey web site:

> The catalog presents the multiwavelength (ultraviolet to mid-infrared)
> photometry available in the GOODS-S field observed as part of CANDELS,
> combining the newly obtained CANDELS HST/WFC3 F105W, F125W, and F160W data
> with existing public data. The catalog is based on source detection in the
> WFC3 F160W mosaic, which includes the data from CANDELS deep and wide
> observations as well as previous ERS and HUDF09 programs. The catalog contains
> 34,930 sources in an area of 173 square arcmin. In addition to the WFC3 bands,
> the catalog also includes data from UV (U band from both CTIO/MOSAIC and
> VLT/VIMOS), optical (HST/ACS F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W, and F850LP), and
> infrared (HST/WFC3 F098M, VLT/ISAAC Ks, VLT/HAWK-I Ks, and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6,
> 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 Î¼m) observations. The limiting magnitudes and weight at each
> source position in each band, covariance indexes of the TFITed photometry of
> low-resolution bands, and a list of SExtractor parameters derived from the
> CANDELS GOODS-S HST (both ACS and WFC3) mosaics are also provided in ancillary
> catalogs.

The catalogue is described in 2013ApJS..207...24G.

The catalogue was downloaded from https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/candels/. The
data folder also contains the associated readme.
