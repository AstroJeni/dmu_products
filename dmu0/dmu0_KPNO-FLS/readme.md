Spitzer First Look Survey (FLS) -- NOAO Extragalactic -- R
==========================================================

This product contains the R catalogue observed by the  National Optical
Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) on the fields of the Spitzer First Look Survey
(FLS).

The catalogue was downloaded from [Vizier
J/AJ/128/1](http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/AJ/128/1/sources),
limited to HELP coverage and separated in one catalogue over ELAIS-N1, and one
over xFLS.

An `internal_id` column was added to each catalogue to uniquely identify each
source as the `Source` column has duplicate values.
