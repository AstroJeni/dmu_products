HELP DMU32 final data repository
===========================

This repository contains all the final HELP catalogues across the various fields. Each folder merges all the data available on each field. The notebook the_end.ipynb also generates a list of files and the code necessary to publish the final data on VO. This is built on using the definition of DR1 objects specified in dmu1.

In general the fits files stored here contain the latest and most complete data products across all of HELP.
