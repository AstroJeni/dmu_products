This folder is the top level folder for the Spitzer MIPS 24 micron
maps collected, homogenised and with value-added by the Herschel
Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP). 

These files are located within or near to the HELP boundaries. Maps
include 

## Folders contained within

* Maps from SWIRE survey team
  * dmu17_ELAIS-N1:
  * dmu17_Lockman-SWIRE
  * dmu17_ELAIS-S1
  * dmu17_CDFS-SWIRE

* Maps from other Spitzer survey teams
  * dmu17_Bootes
  * dmu17_xFLS

* Maps from more than one Spitzer survey team
  * dmu17_XMM-LSS

  * dmu17_HELP-MIPS-maps


* dmu17_SEIP_maps


## Future work
This work can be extended to add Spitzer-MIPS 70 and Spitzer-MIPS 160 micron data.
However, those images are  superceeded by and Herschel-PACS which is
available in most HELP fields.
