## Templates for meta-data files

The HELP standard for documentation of the provenance of data sets is
through the provision of ``YAML" meta files.  These meta files 

This directory contains template files to give the same information in text
files:

- `meta_main.yml` contains the main information on the HELP data product.
- `meta_survey.yml` contains the information on the original survey. When
  several surveys are combined, the work package must provide several files
  `meta_survey_1.yml`, `meta_survey_2.yml`, etc.

Those files are `YAML` containing several items (like FITS keywords) that can
easily be read by a computer programme. You should not worry and only fill the
information after the `:` preserving one blank line between items.
