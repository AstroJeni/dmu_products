*The title above should be meaninful for astronomers*
The files in this folder provide templates for development of HELP
documentation, acknowledgements and navigation.

## Templates for Readme.md

[This file itself](https://github.com/H-E-L-P/dmu_products/tree/master/TEMPLATES/README.md)
is a template for our Readme.md files.

*comments in italics give guidance on what to put in template*


## Templates for meta-data files

The HELP standard for documentation of the provenance of data sets is
through the provision of ``YAML" meta files.  These meta files 

This directory contains template files to give the same information in text
files:

- `meta_main.yml` contains the main information on the HELP data product.
- `meta_survey.yml` contains the information on the original survey. When
  several surveys are combined, the work package must provide several files
  `meta_survey_1.yml`, `meta_survey_2.yml`, etc.

Those files are `YAML` containing several items (like FITS keywords) that can
easily be read by a computer programme. You should not worry and only fill the
information after the `:` preserving one blank line between items.
