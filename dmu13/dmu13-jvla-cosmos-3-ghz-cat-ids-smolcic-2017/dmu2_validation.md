# DMU2 validation report (2017-03-14)

- Unique ID present.
- Catalogue limited to HELP coverage.
- I removed the catalogue from the Github repository as we prefer not to store
  the data there.  The data is available on HeDaM in the dmu_products section.
- Isn't the content of `meta_main.yml` something that should be in
  a `meta_survey.yml` as this seems to describe the survey? If not, the
  description of the survey is missing.
