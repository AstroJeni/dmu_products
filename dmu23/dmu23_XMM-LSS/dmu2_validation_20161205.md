# DMU2 validation report (2016-12-05)

- The readme was forgotten in the mail.
- There is no meta information associated.
- Some OBJID are duplicated but added a `specz_id` does not produce duplicates.

I added a field column and a `specz_id` based on the position like we have in
the specZ table on the VO server.

The updated file is `XMM-LSS-specz-v2.5_helpid_20160512.fits`.
