# DMU2 validation report (2016-12-01)

- There is no README. Is it the same as for previous versions. What is the
  encoding for the `z_source` column.
- There is no meta information associated.  -
- There are duplicates. Some `OBJID` are duplicated. I tried to generate a
  `specz_ID` based on the position with a precision of 0.01 arcsec for the
  public catalogue (that will be ingested in the VO database) but this leads to
  duplicate IDs.
