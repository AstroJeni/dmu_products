# LOFAR Bootes cross-matched catalogue
## This product contains the LOFAR Bootes optical matched catalog with photometry in various optical and infrared bands.

This matched catalog has been produced by combining sources detected at 150 MHz as part of deep LOFAR observations of the Bootes field (Williams et al. 2016) and the NOAO Deep Wide-field Survey (https://www.noao.edu/noao/noaodeep/), Spitzer Deep Wide-field Survey [(Ashby et al. 2009)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...701..428A), and Herschel observations as part of the HerMES program (http://herschel.cf.ac.uk/results/bootes-field). The relevant survey specifications and depths can be found in the papers/links associated with each survey.

The optical catalog is i-band selected, following the methodology of [Brown et al. (2007)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...654..858B). More details about source extraction can be found in this paper.
