Starmasks
==================

This product contains the starmasks for the HELP fields

There is a folder per field containing holes (regions where sources are not detected due
to saturation caused by bright stars) and star masks (regions where bright stars cause
large numbers of artefacts) They are presented in both ds9 region format and MOC format.

e.g. dmu4_sm_ELAIS-N1/holes_ELAIS-N1.reg
